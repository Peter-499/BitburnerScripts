# BitburnerScripts
Scripts I wrote in js to be used in Bitburner, uploaded to be reviewed to hopefully allow the community to help me fix a bug

hackmanager is original while the other scripts are originally by Jrpl, as seen here:
https://github.com/Jrpl/Bitburner-Scripts
I wanted to write a hack manager myself but wouldve used the same executable scripts as the original so figfured I may as well keep them.
